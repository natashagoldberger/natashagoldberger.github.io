							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> From the article, I learned that there are multiple types of Gestalt principles that can be employed for interface design and user experience. I had only known about about a few of these principles from my psychology classes and had not realized that they can be used to enhance a design or have a purposeful outcome on users. I also learned that these principles are not only useful for graphic design, such as icons and graphics, but it can also be useful for website layouts and help to accomplish a web page's function. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was that for each principle the author provided a visual example that helped to make sense of the different types of Gestalt techniques, as well as an example website layout that employed each type of technique. I thought this was really usefulf or understanding how Gestalt principles can be employed in web design. </p>
