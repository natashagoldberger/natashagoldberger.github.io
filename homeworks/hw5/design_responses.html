                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> From the reading I learned that there are many complex design animations that can be used throughout a website. The article contains numerous animation variations that demonstrates how you can make your website very interactive and enhance the user's experience. I also learned that animations can be used to add information or images to a page without making it too cluttered because you had transitions that changes the content. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of the article was seeing the various uses and implementations of animations for different purposes. This allowed me to see that page animations can be used for different things and have different effects on the user's experience. I also liked that it showed animations for both desktop and mobile web pages. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I liked the Converse animation where a circle spins around the color when you choose one and a box goes around the size you choose. I liked this one because it makes something that usually isn't animated more aestheitc and achieves the goal of highlighting something in a unique manner. I also liked the easygrow app where it would have the background color change along with the vegetable and information. This made the interface more interactive and achieved its goal while making the app more unique and high-tech looking. </p>
