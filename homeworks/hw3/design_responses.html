						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something that the article taught me is that typography should be chosen so that it aligns with the purpose of a given medium. Before I had thought that typography should just match the aesthetic / vibe of the thing it's being used for rather than conveying its purpose. Furthermore, I learned that text can be used purposefully to emphasize something or direct attention, whereas I had always prioritized aesthetics and simplicity rather than intentionality. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the author's discussion of font resources as well as his tips and guidance for font pairings. I have never really put much thought into font pairings and tend to always a simple sans serif with some nice header font. I liked how discussed that font pairing can actually improve the readability of a design and promote visual hierarchy. I liked how he then provided multiple websites to help find good font pairings and thoguht this was helpful. </p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Typography is all about experimentation. Itâ€™s both a science and an art." </p>
						</li>
