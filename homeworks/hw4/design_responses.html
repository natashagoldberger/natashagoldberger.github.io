					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> From this article, I learned that in addition to making a website aesthetically pleasing, color coordinated, and overall cohesive, designers must also consider the visual limitations of others. If certain colors are too similar, some users may not be able to differentiate them, diminishing their user experience. Therefore, colors should be used strategically to guide the eyes and contrast information. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite aspect of the article was the author's discussion of how color scales can have accessibility ratings, which allows designers to tell if colors will be perceived well by all audiences. I thought this was interesting because even using different shades of a color can allow visually impaired users to differentiate hues. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “Not creating accessible products is just rude, so don’t be rude.” </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
