						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from this article and found interesting was the author's discussion of how peole are more comfortable with scrolling, which allows product designers to employ more white space without worrying about providing the user with all the necessary information. This was surprising to me because I was under the impression that all of the important information should be included before the page's fold, but you can actually space things out, which makes the page much more readable and visually aesthetic. I also learned that spacing can be strategically used to make groups and guide useer's eyes, rather than just spacing things out to make them more readable. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was seeing how the author actually implements design and white space in his role at Wayfair. This allowed me to see and understand how white space can actually be employed strategically and why padding is important in a real world example. I liked how he explained how designers decide to space things, and the effects and potential perception of these strategies on customers. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Think of white space as a breath of fresh air. Just as humans need air to breathe, designs need white space to breathe." </p>
						</li>
