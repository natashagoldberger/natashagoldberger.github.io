				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned from the article that dark patters can be used to manipulate users by hiding decepetive features within the interface. I have seen many examples of these myself such as when you're downloading a free font or graphic element and it has a download button that is actually a link to a website that typically causes a virus or other malware. However,  I had never considered the other elements disucssed in the article as being dark patters such as friend spams and hidden costs.  </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of the article was when the author explained the different types of dark patterns. I was not aware that there were so many different types of dark patterns and that they were used so often across interfaces, so it was helpful to learn what the different types are and what they look like. I thought this was also helpful for understanding the adversities of these patterns and how they manipulate users.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "A dark pattern is a misleading or otherwise deceptive UI/UX decision that tries to exploit human psychology to get users to do things they don’t really want to do... They’re carefully crafted with a solid understanding of human psychology, and they do not have the user’s interest in mind." </p>
