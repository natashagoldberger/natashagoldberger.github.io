<h3> Part 2 </h2>

<ol>
    <li> From reading the article I realized that app and web design requires more thought than just functional layouts. Instead, interfaces should be both aesthetic and functional in order to encourage user engagement and make it easy for them. I had never really thought about utilzing placeholder texts like the examples she gives and thought that was a helpful because it demonstrates how a less is more approach works well when used in places like the Airbnb search bar and the Twitter composer. </li>				
    <li> My favorite part of the article was honestly the Gifs where it showed each app component build upon the next because it helped to demonstrate how individual features are significant on their own but also important that everything looks good together. I liked how she talked about each detail and explained some of the reasoning behind why people might have chosen to design it that way.</li>
    <li> "What content is visible and more interestingly, what content isnâ€™t?" This was interesting because I think an important part of designing interfaces is considering what information can be left out, such that we might want to include obvious details but don't need to. I think this is important to keep in mind because I prefer cleaner and more minimalist websites and apps that still provide the information you need. </li>
