            <!-- <h6 class="description" id="frontal-description" style="display: none;">The <em>Frontal</em> Lobe <br>
                The frontal lobe is an essential part of the brain, located in the front of the cerebral cortex. It plays a crucial role in a wide range of important functions, 
                including decision-making, problem-solving, planning, attention, memory, and movement. The prefrontal cortex, a region of the frontal lobe, is responsible for higher-order 
                thinking processes such as reasoning, decision-making, and problem-solving, while the motor cortex controls voluntary movements of the body. Additionally, the frontal lobe is 
                involved in emotional regulation and social behavior, with regions such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex responsible for processing emotions and making decisions based on them. 
                Damage to the frontal lobe can result in cognitive and behavioral deficits, making it a vital area to study and understand for both medical and research purposes. </h6>

            <h6 class="description" id="temporal-description" style="display: none;"><strong>The Temporal Lobe</strong><br>

                This gorgeous treat made with flaky <br>dough is filled with fresh raspberries, 
                creamy white chocolate <br>and topped with vanilla glaze. </h6>

            <h6 class="description" id="parietal-description"><strong>The Parietal Lobe</strong><br>
                This delicious cake uses a simple orange and <br>
                almond base to make a show-stopping naked layer <br>
                cake, with three layers of moist almond and orange cake <br>
                topped with a soft ricotta filling, honeycomb, <br>
                candied orange, rose petals and flaked almonds <br>scattered over the top.</h6>

            <h6 class="description" id="occipital-description" style="display: none;"><strong>The Occipital Lobe</strong><br>
                These decadent, bite-sized macarons combine <br>
                dark chocolate macaron shells that have a light crisp, <br>
                outer layer with a chewy, chocolatey center <br>
                that are sandwiched together with a rich, dark <br>
                chocolate fudge frosting. </h6>

                of tiny sandwiches. These can contain whatever <br>
                filling you can dream up, savory or sweet.<br>
                Popular options include: smoked salmon, roast beef, egg salad.</h6> --> 

            <div class="description" id="frontal-description" style="display: none;"> <h1>The <em>Frontal</em> Lobe </h1>
                    <p> The frontal lobe is an essential part of the brain, located in the front of the cerebral cortex. It plays a crucial role in a wide range of important functions,

                <div class="description" id="temporal-description" style="display: none;"> <h1>The <em>Temporal</em> Lobe </h1>
                    <p> The temporal lobe is one of the four main lobes of the brain, located on the sides of the brain above the ears. It is primarily responsible for processing auditory information and plays 
                        a crucial role in language comprehension, memory, and object recognition. The temporal lobe is also involved in processing visual information, particularly in the recognition of faces and 
                        other complex visual stimuli. Additionally, it is responsible for the formation and retrieval of long-term memories, including autobiographical memories and semantic memories related to language,
                         meaning, and concepts. The temporal lobe is also involved in regulating emotions and social behavior. Damage to the temporal lobe can result in various neurological conditions, including amnesia, 
                         auditory hallucinations, and difficulty with language comprehension and recognition of familiar objects and faces. </p></div>
    
                <div class="description" id="parietal-description"> <h1>The <em>Parietal</em> Lobe </h1>
                    <p> The parietal lobe is one of the four main lobes of the brain, located in the upper and back part of the brain behind the frontal lobe. It is primarily responsible for processing sensory information 
                        from different parts of the body, including touch, pain, temperature, and pressure, as well as integrating this information with other sensory information and memories to create a complete picture of 
                        one's environment. The parietal lobe is also involved in spatial awareness, perception of objects and their relationships, and attention to the surrounding world. It plays a crucial role in cognitive 
                        functions such as problem-solving, decision-making, and planning, and it is essential for the ability to perform tasks that require fine motor skills and coordination. Damage to the parietal lobe can 
                        result in various neurological conditions, including apraxia, agnosia, and spatial neglect.</p></div>
    
                <div class="description" id="occipital-description" style="display: none;"> <h1>The <em>Occipital</em> Lobe </h1>
                    <p> The occipital lobe is one of the four main lobes of the brain, located at the back of the brain, behind the parietal and temporal lobes. It is primarily responsible for processing visual information 
                        received from the eyes, including interpreting shapes, colors, and movement. The occipital lobe is also involved in the recognition of faces and other complex visual stimuli. Additionally, the occipital 
                        lobe plays a crucial role in visual perception and spatial awareness. It is responsible for integrating and analyzing visual information and translating it into meaningful perceptions of the world around us. 
                        Damage to the occipital lobe can result in various neurological conditions, including visual agnosia, color blindness, and difficulty with visual perception and spatial awareness. </p></div>
                
                <div class="description" id="cerebellum-description" style="display: none;"> <h1>The <em>Cerebellum</em> </h1>
                    <p> The cerebellum is a structure located at the back of the brain, beneath the occipital lobe, and it is involved in coordinating and regulating movement, balance, and posture. It receives input from the sensory
                         systems in the body, as well as from other regions of the brain, and uses this information to fine-tune motor movements, adjust muscle tone, and maintain balance and stability. The cerebellum is also involved 
                         in cognitive processes such as attention, language, and emotion regulation. It plays a critical role in learning new motor skills and adapting to changes in the environment, such as walking on a slippery surface 
                         or driving a car on a winding road. Damage to the cerebellum can result in various neurological conditions, including ataxia, tremors, and difficulty with motor coordination and balance. </p></div>
